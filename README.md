## How to locally setup database
Check the **[database setup guide](https://github.com/orayanics/MediSynthFinals/blob/master/GUIDE%20Creating%20the%20Database.md)** for a step-by-step guide on how to setup the database. This will result into a creation of 7 tables.

For a visual guide of the tables for the database, kindly check this [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1enqYwj93NbzZFmBWl6ZmajW4bdKk_kGLKIvujs7oF_s/edit?usp=sharing).
